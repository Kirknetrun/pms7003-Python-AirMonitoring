# pms7003-Python-AirMonitoring
Monitoring air quality with a sensor microcomputer using pms7003 with RaspberryPi and python script

This is my last year project where i used RaspberryPi microcomputer with air quality sensr pms7003. The sensor is being operated with a script written in Python.I used RaspberryPi 3B+ with pms7003 Plant Tower attached with IDC PMS7003 adapter using microUSB cable.

In this project i wanted to monitor air quality, alarm the user if the dust intensity is above the norms, collect the data in text file and create the chart from detected data (using matplotlib.pyplot). The chart creating data part is not polished and ended!!!
